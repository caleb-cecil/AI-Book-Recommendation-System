# Book Recommendation System

## Overview
This project implements a book recommendation system using machine learning techniques. It analyzes user ratings and applies cosine similarity to generate personalized book recommendations based on user preferences.

## Features
- Loads and processes book, user, and rating datasets.
- Computes similarity scores using cosine similarity.
- Generates personalized book recommendations.
- Utilizes pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
- Implements data visualization for insights.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Ensure dataset files (`Books.csv`, `Ratings.csv`, `Users.csv`) are in the correct directory.

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to preprocess data.
2. Use the provided functions to generate recommendations based on user inputs.
3. Visualize recommendations and insights.

## Dataset Information
- **Books.csv**: Contains metadata about books.
- **Ratings.csv**: Contains user ratings for books.
- **Users.csv**: Contains user demographic information.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement collaborative filtering techniques.
- Develop a web-based interface for user interaction.
- Improve recommendation accuracy using deep learning.
